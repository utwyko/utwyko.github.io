I recently gave a talk at the Bol.com conference 'Spaces Summit' on how we used Reactive technologies to build a new backend for the Bol.com mobile apps. In the talk, I discuss the pros and cons of a Reactive approach, tell some horror stories about the issues we ran into during the development and I give tips and tricks for building resilient and performant Reactive JVM backend apps. The slides can be found in the description of the YouTube video.
