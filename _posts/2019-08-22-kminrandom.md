Today, I published the 1.0.0 version of KMinRandom, a library for generating random test data in Kotlin. I've been using the library for the past two years at both Bol.com and Blendle without any major issues, so it seems appropriate to publish a "real" version. You can check out the documentation and source code at [GitHub][github]. Any comments, feature requests or ideas are very much welcome!
