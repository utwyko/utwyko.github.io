Hi!

I'm Wyko Rijnsburger, a 28-year-old software engineer currently working at [Disney Streaming][ds].

I've graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a MSc in Information Sciences (Human Centered Multimedia track).

I also had the chance to spend the spring doing an internship in Silicon Valley at the wonderful [FX Palo Alto lab][fxpal], before moving on to my first engineering job at [bol.com][bol.com].
After bol.com I worked as a Android engineer and Mobile Lead at [Blendle][blendle].


At the moment, I'm mostly interested in things such as the JVM, Android, Kotlin and Reactive Programming.
