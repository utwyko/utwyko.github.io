Hi! 

I'm Wyko Rijnsburger, a 24-year-old software engineer currently working at [bol.com][bol.com].

I've graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a MSc in Information Sciences (Human Centered Multimedia track). 
  
I also had the chance to spend the spring doing an internship in Silicon Valley at the wonderful [FX Palo Alto lab][fxpal].


At the moment, I'm mostly interested in things such as the the JVM, Android, Kotlin and Reactive Programming.
